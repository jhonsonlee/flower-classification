## Flower Classification with Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains a notebook describing design flow of a system which is able to classify flower species. The code was written in Python and PyTorch. Users who are beginners in Deep Learning are encouraged to learn some basics about Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in theory to have sense to this notebook. This was a final project for PyTorch Udacity Scholarship Challenge by Facebook.
