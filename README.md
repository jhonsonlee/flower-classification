# Flower Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview
This repository contains a notebook describing design flow of a system which is able to classify flower species. The code was written in Python and PyTorch. Users who are beginners in Deep Learning are encouraged to learn some basics about Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in theory to have sense to this notebook. This was a final project for PyTorch Udacity Scholarship Challenge by Facebook.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository into your machine by typing the following command on your Linux terminal or Windows command prompt.
```
> git clone https://github.com/jhonsonlee/flower-classification.git
```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook in your machine by typing the following command.
```
> jupyter notebook
```
3. On your Jupyter Notebook console head to the directory where your clone the repository and then open `Image Classifier Project - VGG.ipynb`.

Happy scripting! Happy learning!
